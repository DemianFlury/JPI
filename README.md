# JPI - The API for Jokes

This is intended as a small Project where I learn how to make a REST API in Java Spring Boot
The API can tell you a random Joke depending on a category you choose. You should also be able to add, edit and delete Jokes from the database using the API.

## Goals

- [ ] I will invest at least two hours per workday into this project, which gives me a minimum ten hours per week. This will be kept up for at least two weeks.
- [ ] The API can tell a random joke from any category within three days of development starting.
- [ ] The API can tell jokes filtered by category within a week.
- [ ] Jokes can be added to and deleted from the database within eight days of development starting.
- [ ] The database of jokes can be updated via API after two weeks of developing starting.
